        <p>
          I currently work as a freelance software engineer, helping startups
          and teams bring their ideas to life through modern UIs, integrations,
          and scalable backend systems. I&apos;m a long-term contributor at{" "}
          <Link href="https://thecampstack.com" target="_blank">
            TheCampStack
          </Link>
          , where I focus on building recommendation engines, custom workflows
          and developer tooling. Previously I was at{" "}

          on data-driven platforms and automation tools.

          My work spans across building workflows that handle +10,000 of monthly
          invocations to designing user-facing features in high-traffic
          environments. I&apos;m especially drawn to systems that blend product
          thinking with deep technical execution.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of work, I&apos;m a curious mindâ€”following science,
          experimenting with motion design, playing video games, and working
          toward building a meaningful online presence.
